# OpenCL.NetCore
by Gabe C

[Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenCL.NetCore/)

### What is it?
.NET bindings for OpenCL that are easy-to-use and true to the original API. There is no 
OOP abstraction, nor will there ever be. OpenCL.Net is meant to be small, fast (with as 
little explicit marshaling as possible) and .NET friendly at the same time.

OpenCL.NetCore is a fork of [OpenCL.Net by Ananth B](https://github.com/dgsantana/OpenCL.NET/). The main purpose of this project is to modernize OpenCL.Net by giving it proper VS projects and MSTests in .NET Core.
It still needs some testing and debugging.

### .NET 6 is here
Well, the new naming convention of .NET certainly has me questioning my decision to name 
this project OpenCL.NetCore. For now, I will keep the name despite the project being updated for .NET 5.
